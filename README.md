## üíª Technologies Used

- Frontend: Streamlit

- AI & Language Model: Google Gemini 2.5 flash

- Movie Data: The Movie Database (TMDb) API

- Core Language: Python

## üöÄ How It Works: The AI Tool-Use Architecture

The core of this application is its modern AI architecture. Instead of relying on rigid if/else logic, we give the Gemini AI a "tool belt" of functions.

- User Prompt: The user types a natural language request (e.g., "What are some good sci-fi movies like Blade Runner?").

- AI Analysis: The Gemini model analyzes the prompt to understand the user's intent.

- Tool Selection: The AI determines that the user wants movies "similar to" another movie and selects the get_similar_movies tool. It also extracts "Blade Runner" as the required argument.

- Function Execution: The Python application executes the chosen helpers.py function with the arguments provided by the AI.

- API Call: The function calls The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch the relevant movie data.

- Display Results: The results are returned to the Streamlit app, which then displays the movie posters and details in a clean, user-friendly interface.

This architecture makes the application incredibly flexible and easy to extend. To add a new feature, we simply have to write a new tool function and add it to the AI's tool belt.
